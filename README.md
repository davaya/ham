**The "Hello World" Actuator for OpenC2 Messaging**

A stub server demontrating the content- and transport-agnostic OpenC2 Message interface.

A *message* is a logical unit consisting of domain-specific content plus an accompanying set of
domain-independent fields.  The purpose of this code is to show that a message is transferred
end-to-end without modification regardless of the transport protocol, while making use of the
message-related capabilities provided by each transport protocol.
